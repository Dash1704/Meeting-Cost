Generic single-database configuration.

To change existing fields change the fields or table in the class:

class EmployeeCreate(BaseModel):
    first_name: str
    last_name: str
    salary: float
    weekly_hours: float
    company_id: int

And then create the migration with 

```
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Added first_name and last_name to employees"
```

and then apply the migration with:

```
alembic upgrade head
```
