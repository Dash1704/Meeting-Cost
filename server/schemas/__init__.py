# The schemas file defines the structure of the data that the 
# API expects (for requests) and returns (for responses)

# The schemas serve two main purposes:

# Request Validation: Validate the data sent by the client in requests (e.g., POST, PUT).

# Response Serialization: Define the structure of the data returned to the client in responses.
